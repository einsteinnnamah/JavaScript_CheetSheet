/////////////////////1. Values and Variable Types//////////////////////////////

//Value is basically is the smallest unit of information in javaScript e.g//
console.log("Hello World"); // "hello world" is the value
console.log(1); // 1 is the value

//Variable is basically a container for storing a value, 
// we can store any  value either string, number, etc in a variable and reference in anywhere in our code e.g//
let Firstname = "John"; // so here we basically assign the value "John" to the variable name
//for us to access the value of the variable we need to use the variable name e.g//
console.log(Firstname); // we can then access the value of the variable name
//Checking your console we indeed get John printed out//

//Nb:We can also use a variable name more than once e.g//
//Rules for naming variables: 
//1. Variable names can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores
//2. Variable names are case sensitive (upper and lower case letters are different) e.g let firstName = "John" and let firstName = "john" are two different variables
//3. Variable names should not be JS keywords
//4. Variable names should not start with a number
//5. Variable names should not be reserved keywords
//6. Variable names should not be too long or short
//7. Variable names must be descriptive e.g "let = myFirstJob = 'Programmer' not let job1 = 'Programmer'"
